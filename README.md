# A-comparison-of-selected-oversampling-techniques-for-problem-of-detecting-network-attacks
This study evaluates the effectiveness of different oversampling techniques, including SMOTE (and its selected variants), GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks), WGAN (Wasserstein GAN), and their combinations, in improving classification performance, when the data are class imbalanced. Additionally, a non-oversampling baseline was tested to compare how models perform without data augmentation. The impact of these techniques was assessed using selected classifiers. The results of the computational experiment carried out on the data for the problem of identifying and detecting attacks within network traffic are presented and discussed.
